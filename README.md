# Air-Stroke-Applicaiton

Given the real-time webcam data, this air canvas-like python application uses the OpenCV library 
to track an object-of-interest and allows the user to draw by moving the object.

## A Quick Intro To Video Tracking

Video tracking is the process of locating a moving object (or multiple objects) over time using a camera. 
It has a variety of uses, some of which are: human-computer interaction, security and surveillance, video communication, 
augmented reality, traffic control, medical imaging and video editing.

Now, next thing will be 

## What Are Contours?

Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous points (along the boundary), having same color or intensity. 
The contours are a useful tool for shape analysis and object detection and recognition. 
In OpenCV, finding contours is like finding white object from black background.


## Algorithm I used to create the model

1: Import the necessary libraries and initialize variables that are used.

2: Setup The Paint Interface.

3: Start Reading The Video (Frame by Frame).

4: Find The Contour-Of-Interest.

5: Start Drawing And Store The Drawings.

6: Show The Drawings On The Screen.
